title: Stickers â€” Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children will be introduced to linear and radial gradients in CSS. They will also learn more about borders and positioning. 

#Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinkets:

+ ['Sunrise' starting point  -- jumpto.cc/web-sunrise](http://jumpto.cc/web-sunrise)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/html-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-template)](http://jumpto.cc/html-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Stickers' Finished -- trinket.io/html/bb4e538e0a](https://trinket.io/html/bb4e538e0a)

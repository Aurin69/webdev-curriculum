title: Pixel Art â€” Notes for Club Leaders
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children create a pixel art editor. They will be introduced to JavaScript to change the colour of the pixels. They will also learn how to use HTML tables to create a grid of pixels.

#Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinkets:

+ ['Pixel Art' starting point](https://trinket.io/html/web-pixel)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/html-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-template)](http://jumpto.cc/html-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Pixel Art' Finished](https://trinket.io/html/0e102a306b)
